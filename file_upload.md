Huani,

I've been trying to reach to you, I hope you can call me back, or write back.

Hi HN,

It's been two years now. I know things got weird and somewhat toxic in the end. I made most of the mistakes. But I hope both of have moved on and not holding grudges. Well, I don't blame if you just choose to ignore this email entirely. Nothing surprises me these days.

So what I am trying to say is, how are you doing? Are you happy, I know you did well in RMIT and finished your masters in IT. I saw the project photos you put up. I hope you are enjoying this industry. You'll probably not give any credit to me, but I feel like I have inspired you to study IT, at least 1%.

I have been in Melbourne for over a year now. I didn't try to call you until about few weeks ago, realised my number is still blocked ðŸ˜­

I was thinking if we can talk, maybe, if not as anything, just as someone who know each other? There are a lot of things to talk.

Have a good day.
