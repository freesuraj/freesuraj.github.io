Deadlock is a situation when two or more threads are waiting on each other to be completed causing both to be locked and not able to continue.

A practical example of a deadlock is

Let's see an example in swift.

here, the the queue is exeucting with `q.async` first, inside the block it calls for `q.sync`. So the outer block can only complete when the inner block `q.sync` is finished, but `q.sync` cannot start, because it is a `sync` block unless the thread is free. This results in a deadlock and the process will crash.

{% highlight swift %}

import Foundation

class Resource {
	
	private(set) var value: Int
	
	private let q = DispatchQueue(label: "myQueue")
	
	init(_ value: Int) {
		self.value = value
	}

	// Deadlock
	func set(_ value: Int) {
		q.async {
			print("async")
			self.q.sync {
				self.value = value
				print("sync") 	 	// outer block is waiting for this inner block to complete,
        							// inner block won't start before outer block finishes
        							// => deadlock
			}
			print("finished") // this will never be reached
		}
	}
}

let r = Resource(100)
r.set(200)

print("final value \(r.value)")

// Output
// async
// Execution Interrupted due to deadlock
