## Sialect

**Suraj + Dialect = Sialect**. Sialect is a way of communicating in social media, chats and forums. It can only be used in written context, and should not be used in voice chat.

Sialect has two main goals:

- Be more intimate with the person you are directly speaking to
- Minimise the words you need to type to deliver a message
- Make the conversation more interesting by sometimes forcing the receiver to guess the correct word they are using.

### Rules of Sialect

*Sialect* can be used in almost every context, but it has specific rules on how it should be used.

- The most important rule of *Sialect* is to replace the first letter of the sentence with the first initial of the person you are speaking to. 

For example - 


| English          | Sialect   |
|------------------|-----------|
| Congrats, George | Gongrats  |
| G sir Bolo       | Golo      |
| Thank you Sam    | Shank you |


- Use *Sialect* when you would otherwise be addressing the person by their name. Do not use sialect in the middle of the sentence, and when addressing the person's name is not necessary there.

```
For example: 

English: I think George is doing fine.

Sialect: I think George is doing gine. (*do not do this*)

```

- You can also use *Sialect* to shorten the context when you are speaking about a third person with someone. Anywhere you would use *of sb* or *sb's* or *about sb* in English can be shortened by *Sialect*

For example - 


| English                     | Sialect             |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Got any updates about Janak | Got any Jupdates?   |
| Raj's twitter is trending   | Rwitter is trending |
| Phone of Ben is missing     | Bhone is missing    |
