Hi, I'm Suraj Pathak, an iOS Engineer from Nepal. I'm currently living in Singapore, working at [PropertyGuru](http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/). I like to write scalable and reusable softwares. I like drinking fussy coffee, riding motorbikes, adventuring and watching American Football. View my public CV [here](/cv){: target="_blank"}.

Before moving to the warmer Singapore, I was in a cold snow-city of China, Harbin, studying undergraduate at [Harbin Institue of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/). I was specially motivated to learn Chinese language because of Kung-Fu movies as a kid. As a result I decided to go to China after high school.
