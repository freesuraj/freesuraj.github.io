    <p style="font-size:xx-large; text-align: center;">Hi, I'm Suraj Pathak, an iOS Engineer from Nepal. I'm currently living in Singapore, working at <a href="https://www.runsocial.com/">Runsocial</a>. I like to write scalable and reusable softwares. I like drinking fussy coffee, riding motorbikes, adventuring and watching American Football.</p>
    <p style="font-size:large;">
      Before moving to the warmer Singapore, I was in a cold snow-city of China, Harbin, studying undergraduate at <a href="http://en.hit.edu.cn/">Harbin Institue of Technology</a>. I was specially motivated to learn Chinese language because of Kung-Fu movies as a kid. As a result I decided to go to China after high school.

      In 2008, I came to Singapore where I graduated in Computer Science major from <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg">NUS</a>.

    </br><b> External </b></br>
      I advocate open sourcing codes. I have several projects available on <a href="http://github.com/freesuraj"> Github </a>. My email is <a href="mailto: freesuraj@gmail.com"> freesuraj@gmail.com </a>.

    </br><b> Side Projects </b></br>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/musictune/id534960220?ls=1&mt=8"> MusicTune </a> was one of my first iOS apps that I wrote four years ago. It curates top musics from different genre and countries from free internet sources and puts them together as a list of top songs and albums. Since I don't own the music, I'm no longer maintaining this project.
  </br></br>
    <a href="http://freesuraj.wix.com/udine"> Udine </a> is a new start-up that I co-founded. Udine is a O2O platform for sharing home-cooked food. Just like Airbnb and Uber, Udine belongs to the sharing economy ecosystem.
    </br></br>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/food-ferry/id920041683?l=zh&mt=8"> Food Ferry </a> is another app that I freelanced for a client in Singapore. The app provides a faster and convenient way to order food from selected restaurants in Singapore.

  </br><b> Finally </b></br>
    Nepal is a beautiful paradise. Yes, we were hit hard by earthquake and other disasters, but we are recovering. Please visit Nepal whenever you have a chance.
